        <h2 id="Chapter_3">Chapter 3</h2><p>I found the guidelines <strong>identify the major kinds of information your reader wants from your communication</strong> and <strong>describe the way your reader will look for the information</strong> very interesting, they correspond to the reader-centered approach that we talked in the class. Which is more important is that these two guidelines talk both the content and medium of communication. You need to deliver proper information in a proper way. I can still use my summer data analysis project as a example. Two readers of the analysis report are my CTO and CEO. They have different expectations from the report. The CEO wants to know hidden relationship from the data while the CTO wants to know the process of analysis better. So I give them corresponding information separately and use different ways for communication. For the CTO, I gave him mostly charts which is direct and concise, for someone without technical background, it will be a very effective way to get information. For the CEO, I directly paste code snippets. That is exactly what he wants and he has no problem with reading my code.</p>
<p>Also, I think I can keep using these guidelines in my future work. Since once I start a project, there will be people of different roles trying to participate in the project. It is necessary to treat them differently and show them what they actually want.</p>

<h2 id="Chapter_4">Chapter 4</h2><p>According to the reading on chapter 4, the three most helpful guidelines are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Identify your readers’ questions and subquestions</strong></li>
<li><strong>avoid including information your readers don’t need</strong></li>
<li><strong>Organize hierarchically</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The first two guidelines illustrate a very good point similar to the <strong>Requirement</strong> idea we have during the class. When talking about usefulness, we actually talk about the usefulness for the user which is the reader here. Getting exactly what the want can be considered as the most useful. If we provide information that beyond their need, even if the information might be a brilliant idea. But since it is not related with the need, they may not even care about that. Preciseness and Conciseness are two very important components of usefulness.  </p>
<p><strong>Organize hierarchically</strong> is also very helpful since it makes sure that we can get access to stuff we want fast and precisely. Sometimes useful information might be hidden in the terrible layout. In order to make you point stand out, it will be a very wise choice to make a good organization.</p>
<h2 id="Chapter_5">Chapter 5</h2><p>According to my reading, I think the three most helpful guidelines from this chapter are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Present sufficient and reliable evidence</strong></li>
<li><strong>respond to—and learn from—your readers’ concerns and counterarguments</strong></li>
<li><strong>Establish your credibility</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Present sufficient and reliable evidence</strong> is very helpful since it address on the core of persuasion that you are trying to convince others. Plain theories or ideas will not be enough. Like we will always start our pitch by a background story. Sufficient and reliable evidence will make add more details to the abstract idea and make it easier for the receiver to understand.</p>
<p><strong>Respond to—and learn from—your readers’ concerns and counterarguments</strong> is another useful guideline. It uses the same idea of thinking from the perspective of reader. When we switch the role, we can understand what we want better. If the speech right hit what I want then it is definitely a good persuasion.</p>
<p><strong>Establish your credibility</strong> talks about long-term persuasiveness. When we are trying to convince people, two things will be very important. One is the idea and another one is yourself. Like those venture capitalists always say, they invest in people rather than ideas. Once you have created your own credibility in a specific area. You can easily come up with a idea with lots of supports.</p>
