        <h2 id="Part_1:_Write_a_response_to_Anderson’s_Ch-_20-">Part 1: Write a response to Anderson’s Ch. 20.</h2><p>After reading chapter 20, the guideline that I find most useful is <strong>”Choose your visual medium by considering your audience, topic, and purpose”</strong>. I think it is a very interesting point. We usually emphasize too much on the content of presentation. It is true that the idea we are trying to deliver is very very important. But the medium and methodology that we take to approach the actual presentation also matters.</p>
<p>The choice of the visual medium will heavily influence how your audience perceive the ideas. Slides can help to organize the material with bullet points but may be lack of details. A video can be perfect when you trying to show how a app works but will take much longer time to prepare. A poster will be super fast to prepare and can help at the situation without computers. In general, a wise decision on which visual medium to apply will make your presentation much more effective.</p>
<p>My personal methodology is to put a single page PDF with a couple of bullet points and probably hierarchy map. One thing I believe is that presentation is not about reading materials that you have prepared. It should be more like a show where you display your ideas. I will elaborate each point and talk about the relationship between all those points. With both details and general view, my audience can always get the idea that I am trying to deliver.</p>
<h2 id="Part_2:_Read_Oral_Presentation_Tips_and_use_that_info_to_answer_the_following_questions:">Part 2: Read Oral Presentation Tips and use that info to answer the following questions:</h2><ul>
<li>Think about recent presentations you have witnessed. What makes them successful or less successful?</li>
<li>Think about presentations you have given. What could you have done differently? What are your strengths?</li>
</ul>
<p>The recent presentation on the Surface Book by Microsoft gives me a very good impression. It is Microsoft’s annually press release of new products. The first good thing about it is the content. It covers lots of materials with release on not only one product. By starting with the normal upgrade on Windows Phone and Surface Pro. They try to cultivate an atmosphere. While everyone get comfortable with the pace, they then finally showcase the cutting edge Surface Book. It is a good strategy to put the most important thing at the end so audience can get a satisfied result after they start to lower the expectation during the process.</p>
<p>I think my biggest strength when giving presentations is reaction ability. I am trying to make all my presentations to be impressive. Here impressiveness applies to both content and my performance. And I tend to do small fixes by the reaction of my audience. Since when we are preparing for presentations, we always have an expectation on how will audience perceive it. But it is only an estimate and is not accurate at all. By doing small fixes and sometimes even impromptus, I will keep the pace under control and make it more effective.</p>
<h2 id="Part_3:_Read_Presentation_Assignment_Sheet_and_Presentation_Grading_Rubric-_Answer_the_following_questions_about_your_group’s_final_presentation_this_semester:">Part 3:  Read Presentation Assignment Sheet and Presentation Grading Rubric. Answer the following questions about your group’s final presentation this semester:</h2><ul>
<li>How do you plan to break up the presentation? Who will talk about what and why?</li>
<li>What areas will you cover?</li>
<li>How will you showcase your prototype?</li>
<li>What one idea do you want your audience to walk away with? What will your conclusions include?</li>
</ul>
<p>I plan to break it up into three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>What needs to be done?</li>
<li>What have been done?</li>
<li>What are going to be done?</li>
</ul>
<p>Areas I cover will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Objectives</li>
<li>Solutions</li>
<li>Schedule</li>
<li>Prototype</li>
</ul>
<p>We will have a storyboard and the previous team work on this provide us a short video on the general design of the application .</p>
<p>The functionality of the application.</p>
