    </header>
    <div class="entry">
      
        <h2 id="Part_1:_Answer_the_following_questions">Part 1: Answer the following questions</h2><ul>
<li>Which of the three situations on pp. 492-93 does your team face?<ul>
<li>We face the <strong>When Your Readers Define the Problem for You</strong> situation for our project.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Therefore, what tip(s) can you glean from those pages that you’ll apply to your Statement of Work?<ul>
<li>We need to find a way to describe the problme in our own words corresponds with and build on the readers’ description.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What problem or lack is your system meant to solve? (If there are more than one, list them in the most logical order.)<ul>
<li>Optimize the algorithms used in matching process of mentor and mentee.</li>
<li>Combine the previous visual design and app prototype together to make a working demo.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Who is affected?  <ul>
<li>Mentor (Upper Class student)</li>
<li>Mentee (Incoming new freshman)</li>
<li>Administrator</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Are there similar systems in existence, and if so, why can’t they be used?  <ul>
<li>Yes, there’s currently alternative from enterprise software companies. They are too expensive and does not have appealing UI.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is the motivation for the system to be developed?<ul>
<li>Help to bring incoming freshman and fellow students together.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Part_2:_Compare_different_versions_of_problem_statement">Part 2: Compare different versions of problem statement</h2><ul>
<li>Sample 1: Safe House<ul>
<li>The old problem statement keeps talking about current system and current map system while the final version split the problem to different parts(solutions) of the current system and talks about the limitness of them seperately.</li>
<li>The final version shows a more exhaustive list of current solutions and have more complete description on what they can do and can’t do, which is more convincing when we trying to develope something new to replace the old ones.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sample 2: HealthCare<ul>
<li>Compared with the original version, the final problem statement also includes problem from the perspective of doctor and has a more direct connection between use case and disadvantages.</li>
<li>The final version improves a lot since it talks about the disadvantages of the current system for both patients and doctors instead of only patients. It also helps people realize such disadvantages in real use case more directly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Part_3:_Rank_problem_statements">Part 3: Rank problem statements</h2><ul>
<li>Safe House</li>
<li>HealthCare</li>
<li>Website Redesign</li>
</ul>
<p>I rank the safe house in the first place since list all the alternatives and provide enough information about all of them. I can easily get what current system can do and can not do. It is much better than simply listing those disadvantages.  HealthCare is on the second place, it talks about weakness of current system from two different target group of users, but it will be better if the writer can directly separate the problem statement into two parts. Website redesign is the last one. The writer talks a lot about what needs to be improved but these just seem to be too much.  It will be better to figure out a way to categorize and organize them.</p>

        <h2 id="I_will_use_examples_from_CS_field_to_illustrate_different_types_of_definitions">I will use examples from CS field to illustrate different types of definitions</h2><p><strong>Stipulation</strong></p>
<p>We usually use Node to refer to the Node.js framework.</p>
<p><strong>Operational Definition</strong></p>
<p>Data in MongoDB has a flexible schema. Collections do not enforce document structure. Decisions that affect how you model data can affect application performance and database capacity. See Data Modeling Concepts for a full high level overview of data modeling in MongoDB.</p>
<p><strong>Antonym</strong></p>
<p>Asynchronous - Synchronous</p>
<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
<p>As an introduction to the use of MongoDB for operational intelligence and real time analytics use, the document “Storing Log Data” describes several ways and approaches to modeling and storing machine generated data with MongoDB. Then, “Pre-Aggregated Reports” describes methods and strategies for processing data to generate aggregated reports from raw event-data. Finally “Hierarchical Aggregation” presents a method for using MongoDB to process and store hierarchical reports (i.e. per-minute, per-hour, and per-day) from raw event data.</p>
<ul>
<li>Storing Log Data</li>
<li>Pre-Aggregated Reports</li>
<li>Hierarchical Aggregation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fomral Definition</strong></p>
<p>An algorithm is a procedure or formula for solving a problem. The word derives from the name of the mathematician, Mohammed ibn-Musa al-Khwarizmi, who was part of the royal court in Baghdad and who lived from about 780 to 850.</p>
<p><strong>Synonym</strong></p>
<p>Computer vision enables images, or sequences of images, to be processed by a computer using an algorithm. The aim of the algorithm is to extract information from the image. Sometimes this information produces an updated image or sometimes other measurements. We can also call this process image processing.</p>
<p><strong>Etymology</strong></p>
<p>BASIC -<br>computer language, 1964, initialism (acronym) for Beginners’ All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code; invented by Hungarian-born U.S. computer scientist John G. Kemeny (1926-1992) and U.S. computer scientist Thomas E. Kurtz (b.1928).</p>
<p><strong>Negatives</strong></p>
<p>Typically dynamic. Records can add new information on the fly, and unlike SQL table rows, dissimilar data can be stored together as necessary. For some databases (e.g., wide-column stores), it is somewhat more challenging to add new fields dynamically.</p>
<p><strong>Analogy</strong></p>
<p>Asynchronous - I write you a letter. I put it to the postoffice, and it will be sent to you. I the meantime I do NOT WAIT. I do many different other things. Then you receive the letter. You read it while I still do many different other things. Then you write me an answer and send it to me. In all those things I am not involved. At the next day I get a (synchronous) message (a signal) from the system (postman). It (he) says: “Here is a message for you”. Alternatively I could poll my inbox every five minutes to check if a new letter is there. Then I pause my other work, receive your letter and read your answer. Then I do something according to this answer. But this are things you will not notice, because you are not involved in what I do with your asynchronous answer.</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/junior-design-blog/2015/08/30/posting3/">Blog Post 3. Team Work and Working with Clients</a></h1>
  

    </header>
    <div class="entry">
      
        <h2 id="Chapter_19">Chapter 19</h2><p>I would like to talk about a negative experience I have when working on a team project. It is impossible to assign tasks evenly to every single one of the team and sometimes this discrepancy will result in more conflicts between group members. There’s a time when I and a couple of friends gather together and work for a Software Engineering class. We split the work into several parts: write ups , UI/UX, front-end, back-end and testing. Each one will be responsible for one part. We separate those work by functions not by work load. It turns out the one who works on the back-end need to spend much more time since he also needs to work on the implementation of database. Then we have a argument since he feels it is unfair for him to work that much. As the team leader, I spent lots of time to help coordinate but both sides were not happy with the collaboration. I think Anderson’s  guideline that <strong>we need to establish shared responsibility for team progress and cohesion</strong> gonna be very useful here. I assign the work based on each one’s expertise and if you take a part you need to be responsible for that part. And sometimes it is not fair to judge based on actual workload.  If I can I will make each one’s progress more transparent so that everyone can get know their contribution corresponds to the team’s general progress and I believe it will make the collaboration part more smooth.</p>
<h2 id="Chapter_21">Chapter 21</h2><p>I think the guideline <strong>determine what your client wants and why</strong> gonna be a crucial part in our communication. As what have already mentioned in the expected questions in the interview, we will try to figure out details about the client’s requirements before we actually work on it. The time cost for the consultation will be much less than the time cost for those later modifications. Also, if we can  determine what your client wants and why in advance. We can come up with a complete plan for the development which will convince the client to choose our service and help ourselves to make a better allocation of resources. </p>

    <div class="entry">
      
        <h2 id="Presentation_Summary">Presentation Summary</h2><p>It is very important to have topic Sentence because people will decide whether they will keep reading the article by reading the topic sentence. We should put the topic sentence at the beginning since readers have the intention to skip through the whole article. Topic sentence needs to be concise and precise.  </p>
<h2 id="Topic_Sentence_Analysis">Topic Sentence Analysis</h2><ul>
<li><strong>The CAT scan creates an image resembling a “slice” that clearly visualizes anatomical structures within the body.</strong><ul>
<li>The sentence presents a fact about the image that CAT scan can bring us. So the following paragraph will talk about how this image works in details.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Improper downstroke and follow-through can cause the golf ball to either hook and fade to the left or slice and fade to the right.</strong><ul>
<li>The sentence lists two different results of Improper downstroke and follow-through. So the paragraph will talk about these two kinds of results with details description.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Three main types of parachutes are used for skydiving. The most widely used parachute has a round, dome-like canopy.</strong><ul>
<li>The sentence points out 3 main types but only mentions one so far. The paragraph will describe all 3 types of parachutes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>A square parachute provides more maneuverability and a better overall ride than does a conventional round parachute.</strong><ul>
<li>The sentence make a comparison between two different kinds of parachutes but without proofs. The paragraph will explain why one is better than another one with proofs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Two methods of disinfecting treated wastewater are chlorination and ozonation.</strong><ul>
<li>The sentence list 2 different methods so the paragraph will provide more information on those two methods .</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The chlorinator room contains the evaporators, chlorinators, and injectors, three of each. The evaporators are used only when liquid chlorine is being drawn from the containers.</strong><ul>
<li>The sentence talks about three different components in the chlorinator room so the paragraph will talk about each of them in details.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

        <h2 id="Chapter_3">Chapter 3</h2><p>I found the guidelines <strong>identify the major kinds of information your reader wants from your communication</strong> and <strong>describe the way your reader will look for the information</strong> very interesting, they correspond to the reader-centered approach that we talked in the class. Which is more important is that these two guidelines talk both the content and medium of communication. You need to deliver proper information in a proper way. I can still use my summer data analysis project as a example. Two readers of the analysis report are my CTO and CEO. They have different expectations from the report. The CEO wants to know hidden relationship from the data while the CTO wants to know the process of analysis better. So I give them corresponding information separately and use different ways for communication. For the CTO, I gave him mostly charts which is direct and concise, for someone without technical background, it will be a very effective way to get information. For the CEO, I directly paste code snippets. That is exactly what he wants and he has no problem with reading my code.</p>
<p>Also, I think I can keep using these guidelines in my future work. Since once I start a project, there will be people of different roles trying to participate in the project. It is necessary to treat them differently and show them what they actually want.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="Chapter_4">Chapter 4</h2><p>According to the reading on chapter 4, the three most helpful guidelines are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Identify your readers’ questions and subquestions</strong></li>
<li><strong>avoid including information your readers don’t need</strong></li>
<li><strong>Organize hierarchically</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The first two guidelines illustrate a very good point similar to the <strong>Requirement</strong> idea we have during the class. When talking about usefulness, we actually talk about the usefulness for the user which is the reader here. Getting exactly what the want can be considered as the most useful. If we provide information that beyond their need, even if the information might be a brilliant idea. But since it is not related with the need, they may not even care about that. Preciseness and Conciseness are two very important components of usefulness.  </p>
<p><strong>Organize hierarchically</strong> is also very helpful since it makes sure that we can get access to stuff we want fast and precisely. Sometimes useful information might be hidden in the terrible layout. In order to make you point stand out, it will be a very wise choice to make a good organization.</p>
<h2 id="Chapter_5">Chapter 5</h2><p>According to my reading, I think the three most helpful guidelines from this chapter are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Present sufficient and reliable evidence</strong></li>
<li><strong>respond to—and learn from—your readers’ concerns and counterarguments</strong></li>
<li><strong>Establish your credibility</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Present sufficient and reliable evidence</strong> is very helpful since it address on the core of persuasion that you are trying to convince others. Plain theories or ideas will not be enough. Like we will always start our pitch by a background story. Sufficient and reliable evidence will make add more details to the abstract idea and make it easier for the receiver to understand.</p>
<p><strong>Respond to—and learn from—your readers’ concerns and counterarguments</strong> is another useful guideline. It uses the same idea of thinking from the perspective of reader. When we switch the role, we can understand what we want better. If the speech right hit what I want then it is definitely a good persuasion.</p>
<p><strong>Establish your credibility</strong> talks about long-term persuasiveness. When we are trying to convince people, two things will be very important. One is the idea and another one is yourself. Like those venture capitalists always say, they invest in people rather than ideas. Once you have created your own credibility in a specific area. You can easily come up with a idea with lots of supports.</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/junior-design-blog/2015/08/21/Posting/">Blog Posting 1. Reader-Centered Communication and Writing Emails</a></h1>
  

    </header>
    <div class="entry">
      
        <h2 id="Chapter_1">Chapter 1</h2><p>The idea that <strong>Think Constantly about your readers</strong> is very interesting to me. And all the things mentioned in this chapter actually correspond to my experience of summer internship. For the summer internship, I worked as a software developer. One thing I realized most from the internship is that in industry, you will never work alone and you have to cooperate with your co-workers. A large project will usually be split into several parts, and communication here is the key to adhere separate parts together.</p>
<p>One project I did during the summer is a data analysis, which I need to report to both CEO and CTO. Therefore I need to <strong>satisfy different readers in a single communication</strong>. The CEO wants to understand what does the statistic means and the CTO wants to know how I process the data. Thus I used multiple charts and short text descriptions to show the relationship hidden in the data in favor of the CEO and paste necessary code for the need of CTO. And it turns out to be a good balance. The one wants the analysis result can directly go to the charts and the one wants the processing part can directly go to the code.</p>
<p>I think what I read from this chapter will be very essential in my future work. The <strong>Reader-Centered</strong> approach is actually very helpful. It can be applied no matter who do you work for. If you work in a big corporation, you definitely needs to write easy-to-read text for administrative people to understand. If you work for a engineer-driven company, you should include technical details as much as possible. It is actually a “fit-in” problem.</p>
<h2 id="Chapter_2">Chapter 2</h2><p>After Reading Chapter 2, I think <strong>Guideline 3</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Draft a letter that answers the employer’s<br>questions clearly and with details</p>
</blockquote>
<p>will be super important when we trying to send an email to get our desired projects. Sometimes when we are writing the emails, we may add too much irrelevant stuffs. We possibly have very brilliant ideas in the text but they may be shadowed in whole bunch of words. Considering this, we should bullet point all the information that the reader expects. For example, in here, we need to answer following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which project do we want?</li>
<li>Who are we?</li>
<li>What experience do we have to finish this project?</li>
<li>What skill set do we have to finish this project?</li>
<li>Potential working plan for the project</li>
<li>Contact Information</li>
</ul>
<p>By answering these questions, the professor will get to know us and our capabilities to this project better.</p>
<h2 id="Chapter_23">Chapter 23</h2><p>Email Sample:</p>

<p>This is a recent email I have with my research advisor. It is a very bad example because I am quite familiar with him and then I ignored many principles for such a technical communication email.</p>
<p>I’m familiar with him but since he has more experience in this field and is my advisor for the project. I should have written the email in a more respected way. Also, I ignored the guideline that <strong>state you main point up</strong>. I assume we already know we are doing research together so I did not mention the topic for the coming meeting. Also, I did not have <strong>headings and lists</strong> since except the intention of setting up a meeting, I did not have any other information included.</p>
<p>But also, there are several parts which actually correspond to the principles. I followed the guideline of <strong>keep it short</strong>. All I want to know is when to set up a meeting and that is exactly what I asked in the email. Also, I have all the necessary contact information in my signature part, which will be very helpful especially when you email someone that you are not that familiar with.</p>
<p>If I have a chance to reconstruct this email, I will first change the subject and add the topic of “Undergraduate Research”. For a potential meeting time, I will list all my available slots in the format of a view. And since we are going to talk about the research project this semester, I can add my interested areas and topics which will help both of us better prepare for the meeting.  </p>
