        <p>Presentation has become a very important approach to deliver ideas in both school and work. But people always commit different kinds of mistakes during the process. As we discussed in during class: sometimes people can not control their voice and prose well, sometimes they have terrible slides layout.</p>
<p>When I give my presentations, I think I have some specific strength. One thing that I am proud of is that I always have <strong>a good interaction with my audience</strong>. Of course I will prepare before the presentation. But all the preparations are based on my own expectation on how my audience will perceive the information that I was trying to deliver. During the actual process of the presentation, I will try to observe how audience respond to the material and make some small adjustment and even make some improvisation if necessary. This will help the presentation go more smoothly.</p>
<p>Something I did not perform that well must be the content of the presentation. I always focused more on the general idea instead of details since I feel like idas, relationship etc on the general level can reveal more about the nature of the problem. However, without details, it is not convincing enough. By including a couple of examples during the presentation, I think this problem can then be solved. </p>

        <h2 id="Part_1:_Write_a_response_to_Anderson’s_Ch-_20-">Part 1: Write a response to Anderson’s Ch. 20.</h2><p>After reading chapter 20, the guideline that I find most useful is <strong>”Choose your visual medium by considering your audience, topic, and purpose”</strong>. I think it is a very interesting point. We usually emphasize too much on the content of presentation. It is true that the idea we are trying to deliver is very very important. But the medium and methodology that we take to approach the actual presentation also matters.</p>
<p>The choice of the visual medium will heavily influence how your audience perceive the ideas. Slides can help to organize the material with bullet points but may be lack of details. A video can be perfect when you trying to show how a app works but will take much longer time to prepare. A poster will be super fast to prepare and can help at the situation without computers. In general, a wise decision on which visual medium to apply will make your presentation much more effective.</p>
<p>My personal methodology is to put a single page PDF with a couple of bullet points and probably hierarchy map. One thing I believe is that presentation is not about reading materials that you have prepared. It should be more like a show where you display your ideas. I will elaborate each point and talk about the relationship between all those points. With both details and general view, my audience can always get the idea that I am trying to deliver.</p>
<h2 id="Part_2:_Read_Oral_Presentation_Tips_and_use_that_info_to_answer_the_following_questions:">Part 2: Read Oral Presentation Tips and use that info to answer the following questions:</h2><ul>
<li>Think about recent presentations you have witnessed. What makes them successful or less successful?</li>
<li>Think about presentations you have given. What could you have done differently? What are your strengths?</li>
</ul>
<p>The recent presentation on the Surface Book by Microsoft gives me a very good impression. It is Microsoft’s annually press release of new products. The first good thing about it is the content. It covers lots of materials with release on not only one product. By starting with the normal upgrade on Windows Phone and Surface Pro. They try to cultivate an atmosphere. While everyone get comfortable with the pace, they then finally showcase the cutting edge Surface Book. It is a good strategy to put the most important thing at the end so audience can get a satisfied result after they start to lower the expectation during the process.</p>
<p>I think my biggest strength when giving presentations is reaction ability. I am trying to make all my presentations to be impressive. Here impressiveness applies to both content and my performance. And I tend to do small fixes by the reaction of my audience. Since when we are preparing for presentations, we always have an expectation on how will audience perceive it. But it is only an estimate and is not accurate at all. By doing small fixes and sometimes even impromptus, I will keep the pace under control and make it more effective.</p>

<li>How will you showcase your prototype?</li>
<li>What one idea do you want your audience to walk away with? What will your conclusions include?</li>
</ul>
<p>I plan to break it up into three parts:</p>

<li>What needs to be done?</li>
<li>What have been done?</li>
<li>What are going to be done?</li>

        <h2 id="Part_1:_Which_guidelines_from_Chapter_10_do_you_use_on_a_regular_basis?_Provide_specific_examples_with_explanations-">Part 1: Which guidelines from Chapter 10 do you use on a regular basis? Provide specific examples with explanations.</h2><p>There’s lots of useful suggestions on how to build an effective professional style in chapter 10.<br><strong>“Find out what readers think”</strong> is one of the most important guidelines to follow for me. It is the same idea that we have been talking through the whole class. And I have to say reader-centered approach is what we are supposed to learn from the class. We want to make sure that the readers can understand the material and feel in common with we what we write. Resonance will make the article more convincing.  This requires that we must find out what our readers want to know and what methods of communication they prefer. Also, we need to consider the context and background knowledge of readers because these two factors will influence how they perceive information very heavily. Learn more about our primary audience background makes communication efficient and persuasive. For example, our project is a mentor app then there are two main audience groups: mentors and mentees. But the direct client of the project is administrator of the system (a BME professor). Thus our writings may have different readers each time. Write about what each group want is the best way to improve effectiveness of communication.</p>
<h2 id="Part_2:_Examine_Sample_3_and_Sample_2-_Read_the_two_sample_proposals’_Objectives_and_Solution_sections-">Part 2: Examine Sample 3 and Sample 2. Read the two sample proposals’ Objectives and Solution sections.</h2><ul>
<li>Which SOW does a better job linking Solution and Objectives?</li>
<li>How does the better example achieve this link?</li>
<li>How well does the solution address the scope?</li>
</ul>
<p>SOW in sample 3 did a better job linking solution and objectives. Both samples list the solutions corresponds to objectives/ However, when coming to details, sample 3 provides more details while sample 2 emphasizes more on abstract ideas.</p>
<p>In sample 3, it has formulas with definition of each elements in those formulas. Thus we can easily understand the relationship among all the elements. Also, sample 3 lists clear instructions that help to illustrate how each use case flows. By checking all the formulas and instructions, we can easily figure out the logic behind the project.</p>
<p>The solution addressed the scope of the project very well since  it only talked about elements corresponds or relevant to the materials within project scope.</p>
<h2 id="Part_3:_Examine_Sample_1,_Sample_2,_and_Sample_3-_Which_Resources_section_is_more_effective?_What_makes_it_more_effective?">Part 3: Examine Sample 1, Sample 2, and Sample 3. Which Resources section is more effective? What makes it more effective?</h2><p>Sample 2 has the most effective resource section. It uses two well-formated table to show the details. One of the table is for tem-supplied items, another one is for client-supplied items. Each table contains the requirement, reason, source and cost columns. The reason attribute only appears in sample 2. It helps readers to understand why the resources are needed and how they would be used to improve the persuasiveness and effectiveness of  communication. </p>

        <h2 id="How_do_you_understand_the_difference_between_Conclusions_and_Recommendations_in_a_feasibility_report?">How do you understand the difference between Conclusions and Recommendations in a feasibility report?</h2><p>The conclusion made in a feasibility report is a continuity of all the evaluation and research. It is simply a logical comparison process with the objective perspective. A conclusion will be like “after doing some specific research, alternative 1 is good in which way while alternative 2 is good in other perspectives”. Conclusion is more of a summary of all the information that has been gathered for a particular topic. It is a re-statement or re-introduction of everything contained in the report.</p>
<p>The recommendation is then made based on the conclusion to decide which alternative should be taken at the moment or what could be done in the future to make some specific alternatives more viable.  A recommendation will be like “the best solution here is alternative 2 because some specific reason”. It is a decision chosen from both logical comparisons and personal judgements.</p>
<p>These two sections has different functionalities: the conclusion part provides information about all solutions while recommendation part selects one of the option and persuade the client to take. In the Chinese philosophy of communication, it provides both depth and breadth on the same topic. The are independent to each other and make the feasibility report more complete.</p>

<li>Sample 1<ul>
<li><strong>State your main point</strong></li>
<li><strong>Provide a forecasting statement</strong></li>
<li><strong>Include a summary</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The writer starts the introduction part by giving a brief context description. After a short preparation, the writer follows the <strong>State your main point</strong> guideline by describing the problem they’re trying to solve. At the same time, the writer starts <strong>forecasting</strong> what the solution might be by referring to the things expected in the final solution. Then, a very short conclusion is given at the very end. Overall, the introduction section provides a way for readers to get to know the material that gonna be covered in the report before actually reading it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sample 2<ul>
<li><strong>State the main point</strong></li>
<li><strong>Include a summary</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Considering the introduction section, sample 2 follows a similar approach that sample 1 does. The writer first <strong>state the main point</strong> after a brief background description. Then the writer talks about potential alternatives. After that, he or she uses a conclusion to end the introduction. After reading the whole introduction part, I feel like it is a little bit too technical. It will be better if the writer can include more background information.</p>

<li>Sample 1<ul>
<li><strong>Repeat your main point</strong></li>
<li><strong>Summarize your key points</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Sample 1 does a summary on all the discussions before in the report for the conclusion part. However, it does not directly and explicitly repeat all the points mentioned above. On the contrast, the writer repeat all the small comparison and evaluation result again to convince the readers. It will be better if the writer can use bullet points to make a correspondence with the criteria before.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sample 2<ul>
<li><strong>Summarize your key points</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Similar to sample 1, sample 1 does a summary on all the discussions before int the report for the conclusion part. It does not repeat all the main points, instead, it only focused on several main comparison. After those comparison, the writer gives a suggestion on which alternative to choose. And then he or she elaborates more on the alternative chosen. I feel that it has the same problem as sample 1. It will be better if the writer can use bullet points to make a correspondence with the criteria before.</p>

How?</h2><p>With correspondence to the theme of this tech communication class. This chapter on research also has an emphasis on reader-centered approaches. And I found the part of <strong>How to gather information and ideas your readers want and need</strong> most useful. The main goal for conducting research is to gather information and this part is about detailed approaches we take to gather information.</p>
<p>The guideline <strong>use secondary sources your readers will find credible and unbiased</strong> is very useful. We should be able to differ from rumors and fact. When I was in the position of  a reader of a research report, if the writer directly uses statistics or arguments from some website, I will highly doubt the correctness behind it. And if the writer uses some information he or she gets from a published academic report. I will definitely find it more persuasive.  Such a guideline actually corresponds to the requirement of using citations in other communication class. A convincing endorsement will make your argument more powerful.</p>
<p>Another guideline <strong>use primary research methods in a credible and unbiased way</strong> illustrate the same point as above. And it is a complementation of the guideline that <strong>identify the full range of sources and methods that may provide helpful information</strong>.</p>

<p>Another difference between Sample 1 and Sample 2 is that in Sample, it uses relative measurements such as “more” or “less” which is kind of very vague here. However, in Sample 2, it uses actual statistics for comparison. It’s more convincing than simply saying “good” or “bad”.</p>

        <h2 id="Part_1:_Comment_on_Chapter_26">Part 1: Comment on Chapter 26</h2><p>Chapter 26 and the idea of feasibility report behind it provide a very good way of talking about alternatives. Problems that that we are trying to solve in real world are mostly open-ended. The ones who demand the problem to be solved cares more about the result rather than the process. More specifically, they will care about the features, cost etc instead of the technology applied. They need a black-box model and we, as problem-solvers, are those who build such a black-box model for them.</p>
<p>Therefore the feasibility report will be our display of alternatives with pros and cons that help the client to make the decision. It gonna be a reflection of our customer research and implementation planning. So we will have a introduction section to show the general problem(it is like a simplified version of introduction in the problem statement) and We will need to find a measureable way to evaluate all those alternatives. That’s why we have a criteria and evaluation section in the report. Also, methods section will show how we gather information for the evaluation process and make it more convincing. At the end of the report,  conclusion and recommendation section will give a guideline on how to choose the alternative and possible future steps.</p>
<h2 id="Part_2:_Examine_the_feasibility_report_samples">Part 2: Examine the feasibility report samples</h2><p>Both feasibility reports follow the same superstructure provided in the book. They all have the required 7 sections like what we can see on page 542 of the text book.</p>
<p>Sample 1 did a very good job by following the structure. And in criteria, methods and evaluation section, it uses categorization and bullet point to make it more organized and clear. And the writer also included diagrams and charts to help the evaluation process which is more convincing.</p>
<p>Sample 2 used the similar organization techniques that sample 1 did. Categorization and bullet points make the report concise and precise. And the writer provide us the evaluation chart before the actual details which is more straightforward. </p>
