How? Which guidelines from Chapter 11 did the authors follow in the Introduction of Sample 2? How? What would be some of the ways to improve these introductions?</h2><ul>
<li>Sample 1<ul>
<li><strong>State your main point</strong></li>
<li><strong>Provide a forecasting statement</strong></li>
<li><strong>Include a summary</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The writer starts the introduction part by giving a brief context description. After a short preparation, the writer follows the <strong>State your main point</strong> guideline by describing the problem they’re trying to solve. At the same time, the writer starts <strong>forecasting</strong> what the solution might be by referring to the things expected in the final solution. Then, a very short conclusion is given at the very end. Overall, the introduction section provides a way for readers to get to know the material that gonna be covered in the report before actually reading it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sample 2<ul>
<li><strong>State the main point</strong></li>
<li><strong>Include a summary</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Considering the introduction section, sample 2 follows a similar approach that sample 1 does. The writer first <strong>state the main point</strong> after a brief background description. Then the writer talks about potential alternatives. After that, he or she uses a conclusion to end the introduction. After reading the whole introduction part, I feel like it is a little bit too technical. It will be better if the writer can include more background information.</p>

How? Which guidelines from Chapter 11 did the authors follow in the Conclusions/Recommendations of Sample 2? How? What would be some of the ways to improve these sections?</h2><ul>
<li>Sample 1<ul>
<li><strong>Repeat your main point</strong></li>
<li><strong>Summarize your key points</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Sample 1 does a summary on all the discussions before in the report for the conclusion part. However, it does not directly and explicitly repeat all the points mentioned above. On the contrast, the writer repeat all the small comparison and evaluation result again to convince the readers. It will be better if the writer can use bullet points to make a correspondence with the criteria before.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sample 2<ul>
<li><strong>Summarize your key points</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Similar to sample 1, sample 1 does a summary on all the discussions before int the report for the conclusion part. It does not repeat all the main points, instead, it only focused on several main comparison. After those comparison, the writer gives a suggestion on which alternative to choose. And then he or she elaborates more on the alternative chosen. I feel that it has the same problem as sample 1. It will be better if the writer can use bullet points to make a correspondence with the criteria before.</p>

        <h2 id="Part_1:_Please_comment_on_Chapter_6-_What_could_be_applied_to_CS_research?_How?">Part 1: Please comment on Chapter 6. What could be applied to CS research? How?</h2><p>With correspondence to the theme of this tech communication class. This chapter on research also has an emphasis on reader-centered approaches. And I found the part of <strong>How to gather information and ideas your readers want and need</strong> most useful. The main goal for conducting research is to gather information and this part is about detailed approaches we take to gather information.</p>
<p>The guideline <strong>use secondary sources your readers will find credible and unbiased</strong> is very useful. We should be able to differ from rumors and fact. When I was in the position of  a reader of a research report, if the writer directly uses statistics or arguments from some website, I will highly doubt the correctness behind it. And if the writer uses some information he or she gets from a published academic report. I will definitely find it more persuasive.  Such a guideline actually corresponds to the requirement of using citations in other communication class. A convincing endorsement will make your argument more powerful.</p>
<p>Another guideline <strong>use primary research methods in a credible and unbiased way</strong> illustrate the same point as above. And it is a complementation of the guideline that <strong>identify the full range of sources and methods that may provide helpful information</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Part_2:_Examine_the_Methods_section_from_the_2_documents:_Example_2_and_Example_3-_Make_a_list_of_the_methods_used_for_evaluation-_Including_the_methods_from_Anderson_(Ch-7),_what_other_methods_might_the_teams_have_employed_for_each_criterion?_List_at_least_one_new_method_per_criterion-">Part 2: Examine the Methods section from the 2 documents: Example 2 and Example 3. Make a list of the methods used for evaluation. Including the methods from Anderson (Ch.7), what other methods might the teams have employed for each criterion? List at least one new method per criterion.</h2><h3 id="Sample_2">Sample 2</h3><ul>
<li>Running Experiment</li>
<li>Conducting Interviews</li>
<li>Searching the Internet</li>
<li>Conducting Survey (the team might have employed)</li>

Compare the Evaluation sections in these two documents. Think about better ways to have communicated the results to the audience and include these ideas/suggestions in your comments.</h2><p>Sample 1 and Sample 2 have different order of aligning evaluation chart and descriptions. Sample 1 put the descriptions at first and then display the chart while Sample 2 does it in the reverse way. I think the layout of Sample 2 is better since it provides a general idea (conclusion) first, an interesting or a huge contrast between alternatives will attract the reader to dig more.</p>
<p>Another difference between Sample 1 and Sample 2 is that in Sample, it uses relative measurements such as “more” or “less” which is kind of very vague here. However, in Sample 2, it uses actual statistics for comparison. It’s more convincing than simply saying “good” or “bad”.</p>

        <h2 id="Part_1:_Comment_on_Chapter_26">Part 1: Comment on Chapter 26</h2><p>Chapter 26 and the idea of feasibility report behind it provide a very good way of talking about alternatives. Problems that that we are trying to solve in real world are mostly open-ended. The ones who demand the problem to be solved cares more about the result rather than the process. More specifically, they will care about the features, cost etc instead of the technology applied. They need a black-box model and we, as problem-solvers, are those who build such a black-box model for them.</p>
<p>Therefore the feasibility report will be our display of alternatives with pros and cons that help the client to make the decision. It gonna be a reflection of our customer research and implementation planning. So we will have a introduction section to show the general problem(it is like a simplified version of introduction in the problem statement) and We will need to find a measureable way to evaluate all those alternatives. That’s why we have a criteria and evaluation section in the report. Also, methods section will show how we gather information for the evaluation process and make it more convincing. At the end of the report,  conclusion and recommendation section will give a guideline on how to choose the alternative and possible future steps.</p>
<h2 id="Part_2:_Examine_the_feasibility_report_samples">Part 2: Examine the feasibility report samples</h2><p>Both feasibility reports follow the same superstructure provided in the book. They all have the required 7 sections like what we can see on page 542 of the text book.</p>
<p>Sample 1 did a very good job by following the structure. And in criteria, methods and evaluation section, it uses categorization and bullet point to make it more organized and clear. And the writer also included diagrams and charts to help the evaluation process which is more convincing.</p>
<p>Sample 2 used the similar organization techniques that sample 1 did. Categorization and bullet points make the report concise and precise. And the writer provide us the evaluation chart before the actual details which is more straightforward. </p>

<li>Sample 3: Website redesign</li>
</ul>
<p>For sample 2, it has very good parallelism together with details. One thing that could be improved is that the writer can move the repeated part to the beginning of each section.</p>
<p>For sample 1, those objectives are not 100 per cent parallel. And the “non-functional requirements” section should start with “the application must”.</p>
<p>For sample 3, the objectives does not have all the sections required and they are not parallel.</p>

        <h2 id="Chapter_8">Chapter 8</h2><p>After reading chapter 8, I found the guideline that <strong>present your generalizations before your details</strong> very useful. It is similar to the the idea of <strong>topic sentence</strong> that we talked before. It is good to present the general ideas in advance. For example, if I want to convince people using Node.js in a blog post. It will be better for me to list the key features in each paragraph before going to details. If I put asynchronous and multithreading in the beginning of paragraphs. Readers will definitely feel interest and go ahead to explore what is in the paragraph. If I put too much unnecessary stuff before going to the actual part, readers may already feel bored before going actual useful information.</p>
<p>Another guideline I feel very useful is <strong>consider your reader’s cultural background when organizing</strong>. Context is always a very important part i communication. People from different background will have different thinking mode. If you can cater into that, it will be much easier to convince them. For instance, Germans may like accurate statistics, Chinese may like compliments while jokes will be okay for people from United States. It’s not about stereotype but about techniques in communication. If you understand others as good as yourself, it will be much easier to communicate with them.</p>
<h2 id="Chapter_16">Chapter 16</h2><p>I’m really interested in the role of design in highlighting and presenting the subject matter. It reminds me of my daily experience of cellphone usage and web browsing. I tend to read more with app with good UI/UX designs. That is also the reason why big companies like Google and Microsoft change their visual identities. Actually, resume will be such a good example for this topic. Previously, I have all my information stacked on my resume. It is true that I have lots of information included in the resume. But it’s so hard to find bullet points. Everything seems to be on the same level and it is even hard to identify between different sections. Then I start using LaTex for my resume, bold and underline all the section titles. After that, I use bullet points to list technology used and my role for each project. It turns out to be a good change since now it is much easier for recruiters to get useful information from a single sheet of paper.<br>What surprised me here is that physical features is also an element of communication. We usually tend to focus more on the content. I have never thought of physical features here.  Different texture or shape will give you different feelings when expressing the same idea.</p>

        <h2 id="Part_1:_Answer_the_following_questions">Part 1: Answer the following questions</h2><ul>
<li>Which of the three situations on pp. 492-93 does your team face?<ul>
<li>We face the <strong>When Your Readers Define the Problem for You</strong> situation for our project.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Therefore, what tip(s) can you glean from those pages that you’ll apply to your Statement of Work?<ul>
<li>We need to find a way to describe the problme in our own words corresponds with and build on the readers’ description.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What problem or lack is your system meant to solve? (If there are more than one, list them in the most logical order.)<ul>
<li>Optimize the algorithms used in matching process of mentor and mentee.</li>
<li>Combine the previous visual design and app prototype together to make a working demo.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Who is affected?  <ul>
<li>Mentor (Upper Class student)</li>
<li>Mentee (Incoming new freshman)</li>
<li>Administrator</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Are there similar systems in existence, and if so, why can’t they be used?  <ul>
<li>Yes, there’s currently alternative from enterprise software companies. They are too expensive and does not have appealing UI.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is the motivation for the system to be developed?<ul>
<li>Help to bring incoming freshman and fellow students together.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Part_2:_Compare_different_versions_of_problem_statement">Part 2: Compare different versions of problem statement</h2><ul>
<li>Sample 1: Safe House<ul>
<li>The old problem statement keeps talking about current system and current map system while the final version split the problem to different parts(solutions) of the current system and talks about the limitness of them seperately.</li>
<li>The final version shows a more exhaustive list of current solutions and have more complete description on what they can do and can’t do, which is more convincing when we trying to develope something new to replace the old ones.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sample 2: HealthCare<ul>
<li>Compared with the original version, the final problem statement also includes problem from the perspective of doctor and has a more direct connection between use case and disadvantages.</li>
<li>The final version improves a lot since it talks about the disadvantages of the current system for both patients and doctors instead of only patients. It also helps people realize such disadvantages in real use case more directly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Part_3:_Rank_problem_statements">Part 3: Rank problem statements</h2><ul>
<li>Safe House</li>
<li>HealthCare</li>
<li>Website Redesign</li>
</ul>
<p>I rank the safe house in the first place since list all the alternatives and provide enough information about all of them. I can easily get what current system can do and can not do. It is much better than simply listing those disadvantages.  HealthCare is on the second place, it talks about weakness of current system from two different target group of users, but it will be better if the writer can directly separate the problem statement into two parts. Website redesign is the last one. The writer talks a lot about what needs to be improved but these just seem to be too much.  It will be better to figure out a way to categorize and organize them.</p>
