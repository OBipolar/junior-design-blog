        <h2 id="Chapter_3">Chapter 3</h2><p>I found the guidelines <strong>identify the major kinds of information your reader wants from your communication</strong> and <strong>describe the way your reader will look for the information</strong> very interesting, they correspond to the reader-centered approach that we talked in the class. Which is more important is that these two guidelines talk both the content and medium of communication. You need to deliver proper information in a proper way. I can still use my summer data analysis project as a example. Two readers of the analysis report are my CTO and CEO. They have different expectations from the report. The CEO wants to know hidden relationship from the data while the CTO wants to know the process of analysis better. So I give them corresponding information separately and use different ways for communication. For the CTO, I gave him mostly charts which is direct and concise, for someone without technical background, it will be a very effective way to get information. For the CEO, I directly paste code snippets. That is exactly what he wants and he has no problem with reading my code.</p>
<p>Also, I think I can keep using these guidelines in my future work. Since once I start a project, there will be people of different roles trying to participate in the project. It is necessary to treat them differently and show them what they actually want.</p>
<h2 id="Chapter_4">Chapter 4</h2><p>According to the reading on chapter 4, the three most helpful guidelines are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Identify your readers’ questions and subquestions</strong></li>
<li><strong>avoid including information your readers don’t need</strong></li>
<li><strong>Organize hierarchically</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The first two guidelines illustrate a very good point similar to the <strong>Requirement</strong> idea we have during the class. When talking about usefulness, we actually talk about the usefulness for the user which is the reader here. Getting exactly what the want can be considered as the most useful. If we provide information that beyond their need, even if the information might be a brilliant idea. But since it is not related with the need, they may not even care about that. Preciseness and Conciseness are two very important components of usefulness.  </p>
<p><strong>Organize hierarchically</strong> is also very helpful since it makes sure that we can get access to stuff we want fast and precisely. Sometimes useful information might be hidden in the terrible layout. In order to make you point stand out, it will be a very wise choice to make a good organization.</p>
<h2 id="Chapter_5">Chapter 5</h2><p>According to my reading, I think the three most helpful guidelines from this chapter are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Present sufficient and reliable evidence</strong></li>
<li><strong>respond to—and learn from—your readers’ concerns and counterarguments</strong></li>
<li><strong>Establish your credibility</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Present sufficient and reliable evidence</strong> is very helpful since it address on the core of persuasion that you are trying to convince others. Plain theories or ideas will not be enough. Like we will always start our pitch by a background story. Sufficient and reliable evidence will make add more details to the abstract idea and make it easier for the receiver to understand.</p>
<p><strong>Respond to—and learn from—your readers’ concerns and counterarguments</strong> is another useful guideline. It uses the same idea of thinking from the perspective of reader. When we switch the role, we can understand what we want better. If the speech right hit what I want then it is definitely a good persuasion.</p>
<p><strong>Establish your credibility</strong> talks about long-term persuasiveness. When we are trying to convince people, two things will be very important. One is the idea and another one is yourself. Like those venture capitalists always say, they invest in people rather than ideas. Once you have created your own credibility in a specific area. You can easily come up with a idea with lots of supports.</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/junior-design-blog/2015/08/21/Posting/">Blog Posting 1. Reader-Centered Communication and Writing Emails</a></h1>

    <div class="entry">
      
        <h2 id="Chapter_1">Chapter 1</h2><p>The idea that <strong>Think Constantly about your readers</strong> is very interesting to me. And all the things mentioned in this chapter actually correspond to my experience of summer internship. For the summer internship, I worked as a software developer. One thing I realized most from the internship is that in industry, you will never work alone and you have to cooperate with your co-workers. A large project will usually be split into several parts, and communication here is the key to adhere separate parts together.</p>
<p>One project I did during the summer is a data analysis, which I need to report to both CEO and CTO. Therefore I need to <strong>satisfy different readers in a single communication</strong>. The CEO wants to understand what does the statistic means and the CTO wants to know how I process the data. Thus I used multiple charts and short text descriptions to show the relationship hidden in the data in favor of the CEO and paste necessary code for the need of CTO. And it turns out to be a good balance. The one wants the analysis result can directly go to the charts and the one wants the processing part can directly go to the code.</p>
<p>I think what I read from this chapter will be very essential in my future work. The <strong>Reader-Centered</strong> approach is actually very helpful. It can be applied no matter who do you work for. If you work in a big corporation, you definitely needs to write easy-to-read text for administrative people to understand. If you work for a engineer-driven company, you should include technical details as much as possible. It is actually a “fit-in” problem.</p>
<h2 id="Chapter_2">Chapter 2</h2><p>After Reading Chapter 2, I think <strong>Guideline 3</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Draft a letter that answers the employer’s<br>questions clearly and with details</p>
</blockquote>
<p>will be super important when we trying to send an email to get our desired projects. Sometimes when we are writing the emails, we may add too much irrelevant stuffs. We possibly have very brilliant ideas in the text but they may be shadowed in whole bunch of words. Considering this, we should bullet point all the information that the reader expects. For example, in here, we need to answer following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which project do we want?</li>
<li>Who are we?</li>
<li>What experience do we have to finish this project?</li>
<li>What skill set do we have to finish this project?</li>
<li>Potential working plan for the project</li>
<li>Contact Information</li>
</ul>
<p>By answering these questions, the professor will get to know us and our capabilities to this project better.</p>
<h2 id="Chapter_23">Chapter 23</h2><p>Email Sample:</p>
<p><img src="images/EmailSample.bmp" alt=""></p>
<p>This is a recent email I have with my research advisor. It is a very bad example because I am quite familiar with him and then I ignored many principles for such a technical communication email.</p>
<p>I’m familiar with him but since he has more experience in this field and is my advisor for the project. I should have written the email in a more respected way. Also, I ignored the guideline that <strong>state you main point up</strong>. I assume we already know we are doing research together so I did not mention the topic for the coming meeting. Also, I did not have <strong>headings and lists</strong> since except the intention of setting up a meeting, I did not have any other information included.</p>
<p>But also, there are several parts which actually correspond to the principles. I followed the guideline of <strong>keep it short</strong>. All I want to know is when to set up a meeting and that is exactly what I asked in the email. Also, I have all the necessary contact information in my signature part, which will be very helpful especially when you email someone that you are not that familiar with.</p>
<p>If I have a chance to reconstruct this email, I will first change the subject and add the topic of “Undergraduate Research”. For a potential meeting time, I will list all my available slots in the format of a view. And since we are going to talk about the research project this semester, I can add my interested areas and topics which will help both of us better prepare for the meeting.  </p>
